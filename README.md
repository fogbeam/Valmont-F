## Overview
ArrowSmith - (The beginnings of) a re-implementation of the classic [ArrowSmith](http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu/arrowsmith_uic/) [Literature Based Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature-based_discovery) system, using Groovy and Grails.

This is a learning platform of anyone interested in LBD to play and experiment.  Our
first goal is to re-implement the classic algorithm(s) that [Don Swanson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_R._Swanson) developed, and then start looking for new and interesting variations and additions.  

As such, one of our primary goals here is to make this as modular and pluggable as possible, in
order to facilitate experimenting with novel approaches to Literature Based Discovery.

This is very much a Work In Progress at the moment, and the original A-B-C discovery algorithm is only partly implemented. Look for more on this coming soon.
