ArrowSmith - A re-implementation of the classic ArrowSmith Literature Based Discovery
system, using Groovy and Grails.

This is a learning platform of anyone interested in LBD to play and experiment.  Our
first goal is to re-implement the classic algorithm(s) that Don Swanson developed, and
then start looking for new and interesting variations and additions.  

As such, one of our primary goals here is to make this as modular and pluggable as possible, in
order to facilitate experimenting with novel approaches to Literature Based Discovery.
