			<h1>Welcome to Valmont/F!</h1>
			<p>
			  This is an open source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature-based_discovery">Literature Based Discovery</a> system by Fogbeam Labs, which includes a re-implementation of the classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowsmith_System">ArrowSmith</a> system. 
			  This application is designed to be a flexible and extensible platform for experimenting with new 
			  algorithms and approaches to Literature Based Discovery (and, perhaps, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_extraction">Knowledge Discovery</a> in general).
			 </p>
			 <p>
			  The <a href="https://github.com/fogbeam/Valmont-F/">project on GitHub.</a>
			</p>
			<p>
			Here we will experiment with, and learn about, Literature Based Discovery
			and hopefully come up with some innovative new approaches to doing knowledge discovery using a corpus of literature in a domain.  We will also be working to (eventually) integrate this work into our Fogbeam Labs product
			offerings.
